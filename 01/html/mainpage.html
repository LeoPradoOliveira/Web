                <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
                <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr
                        title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr
                        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
                <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
                    efforts of folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr
                        title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>
                <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin
                    to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion.
                    Become one with the web.</p>

                <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
                <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The
                    Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing
                    designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr
                        title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed
                    is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a
                    hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
                    demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create
                    beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can
                    always push it further.</p>

                    commented well enough that even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them

                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS
                        1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp;
                        4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be
                    provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr
                        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2%
                    of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr
                        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
                <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr
                        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see
                    fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the
                    web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be
                    possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design
                    should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over
                    90% of the population).</p>
                <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                    material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work.
                    We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
                <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics
